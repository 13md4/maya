      <p>During this project we have been focusing on ourselves and an object in the museum. The first session we had, we were asked to identify what makes a person's identity. The second session consisted of taking pictures of museum objects and one of our prized possessions. During our third session, we used photohop to create a picture which consisted of a collage of miscellaneous photos and a piece of text that said whatever we wanted. The photo below was what I made</p>

      <p>I shared an object with a fellow student, Fenix. We both had one of the coins from the Korean coin display because it reminded us both of our object. The square cut-out in the the coin reminded me of the aperture in my camera and the home button on Fenix's iPad. It also linked with curreny because cameras and iPads are equally expensive.</p>
      <p>I still like the British museum, visiting it after a long time and I really enjoyed this project. I also really enjoyed visiting the Korean gallery because I listen to kpop so it was interesting seeing Korean artifacts.</p>
